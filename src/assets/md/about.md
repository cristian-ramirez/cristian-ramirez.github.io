Hi there, this is Cristian,

I'm senior software developer with more than 10 years of experience in Javascript and Typescript.

I love to be part of the whole process of development from the backend to the frontend, my experience in the frontend
side include Next/React (whole ecosystem) as main lib, but also I've been working with Vue3, also testing tools like
Jest, Enzyme, Cypress and Playwright; and virtualization tools like Docker and Vagrant.

On the other hand, my backend experience is focus in Node tools such as Express.js and Nestjs, TypeORM and Prisma as
libs
to query databases, and regarding databases I mainly worked on Postgres and Firebase.

I'm open to learn new technologies and languages, taking challenges as part of my career path to let me grow in
different areas.

My journey as web developer include multiple companies in different projects
