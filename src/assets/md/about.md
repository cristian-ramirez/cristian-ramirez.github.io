Hi there, this is Cristian, 

I'm senior software developer with with more than 10 years of experience in Javascript and Typescript.

I love to be part of the whole process of development from the backend to the frontend, my experiance in the frontend side include Next/React (whole ecosystem) as main lib but also I've been working with Vue3, also testing tools like Jest, Enzyme, Cypress and Playwright; and vitualization tools like Docker and Vagrant.

On the other hand, my backend experience is focus in Node tools such as Expressjs and Nestjs, TypeORM and Prisma as libs to query data bases, and regarding to databases I mainly worked on Postgress and Firebase.

I'm open to learn new technologies and languages, taking challenges as part of my career path to let me grow in different areas.
